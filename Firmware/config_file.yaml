# Costmap Common Parameters

# --- Robot Dimensions (Important for obstacle avoidance!) ---
# Define the robot footprint shape as a polygon (x, y coordinates relative to base_link center)
# The robot's costmap will grow around this shape.
robot_radius: 0.25 # If you prefer a circular robot model (radius in meters)

# OR: Use a polygon for a rectangular robot (more accurate)
# footprint: [[0.25, 0.25], [0.25, -0.25], [-0.25, -0.25], [-0.25, 0.25]] # Example 50cm x 50cm

# --- Sensor Definitions (How the robot sees the world) ---
# We define the laser (LiDAR) input

laser_layer:
  # General settings
  enabled: true
  obstacle_range: 2.0    # Max range to consider obstacles (meters)
  raytrace_range: 3.0    # Max range to clear obstacles behind the robot's path (meters)
  max_obstacle_height: 0.5 # Maximum height of an obstacle to be considered

  # Sensor source definitions
  observation_sources: laser_scan_sensor
  
  laser_scan_sensor:
    data_type: LaserScan
    topic: /scan         # Standard ROS topic for LiDAR data (will be published by your RPLiDAR node)
    marking: true        # Mark cells as occupied
    clearing: true       # Clear cells as free space
    min_obstacle_height: 0.05  # Ignore points below this height (prevents false positives from floor reflections)
